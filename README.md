# Fixed-term contracts and wages: Rent-sharing and compensating differentials

Code for the analysis in my paper ["Fixed-term contracts and wages: Rent-sharing and compensating differentials"](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zyrru364jnu5lam1c9jip/Fixed_term_contracts_and_wages__Rent_sharing_and_compensating_differentials-1.pdf?rlkey=zt6t9ztobg7xu8zigi1mhhyd1&dl=0).

The run_all file can be used to run the full analysis.

The numbered files do the data manipulation of the various administrative data sources. These are not publicly available, but can be accessed through an agreement with the CASD.
There are also some Jupyter notebooks which run the AKM analysis in Python using the PyTwoWay package.
